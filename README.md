These are some utilities using AWS CLI to handle instances, mainly Nuxeo Instances deployed on AWS by the [Hyland-Nuxeo](https://hyland.com/nuxeo) Presales team.

For all the work of the team, all the plugins etc., see [Nuxeo Sandbox](https://github.com/nuxeo-sandbox)

You, of course, need to be logged in to AWS before running any of these scripts.
